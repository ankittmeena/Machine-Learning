Data Set -
    Heart Failure Prediction

About dataset -
    Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and 
    this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.
    People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk 
    (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia 
    or already established disease) need early detection and management where in 
    a machine learning model can be of great help.

usage of dataset - 
    we can Create a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.
